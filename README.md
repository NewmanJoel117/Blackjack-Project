# Blackjack Project

This Python project, developed by Onyedika Joel Chukwuka, simulates a game of Blackjack following the traditional rules. Below are the key features and functionalities of the program:

## Key Features:
1. **Unlimited Deck**: The deck used in the game is unlimited in size and does not contain jokers. It consists of cards numbered from 2 to 10, along with face cards (Jack, Queen, King), each of which counts as 10. Additionally, the Ace can count as either 11 or 1, depending on the player's choice.

2. **Game Logic**: The program accurately follows the rules of Blackjack, including dealing cards to the player and the dealer, calculating scores, and determining the winner based on the final scores.

3. **User Interaction**: Users can decide whether to draw additional cards or pass during their turn, adding an interactive element to the game.

4. **Computer Dealer**: The computer acts as the dealer, drawing cards based on predefined rules until its score reaches a certain threshold.

5. **Result Display**: At the end of each game, the program displays the final hands and scores of both the player and the computer, along with the result (win, lose, or draw).

## Usage:
To play the game, simply run the Python script. The program will prompt you to start a new game of Blackjack. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the game and make decisions during your turn. Once the game concludes, you have the option to restart and play again.

## Project Structure:
- `blackjack.py`: The main Python script containing the Blackjack game logic.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `LICENSE`: The license file for the project, specifying usage rights and permissions.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- No additional dependencies or libraries are required.

## Getting Started:
1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Run the `blackjack.py` script using a Python interpreter.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Contribution:
Contributions to the project are welcome. If you encounter any bugs, have suggestions for improvements, or want to add new features, feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
